    Learning and using tinker cad to design the board and the pieces. 
    I am trying to figure out the best way to get the magnets into the pieces after printing. 
    Snap together pieces where I print 2 parts a top and bottom might work best.

    The parts are taking longer than I thought to print so I cut down the hexagon to just one section of the 
    hexagon to test out different methods of inserting magnets. 
    The snap together design is a bit finicky for my 3-d printer. 
    Also the way I've designed them once I press them together they do not come apart unless you break the pieces.
    This is good in a way that they will not come apart but bad for prototyping.
    Perhaps just pressing the magnets through holes that leads into a cavity inside the hexagon would work. 
    If the magnets are slightly smaller and the hole is on a diagonal maybe that would be enough to prevent
    the magnets from falling out.
