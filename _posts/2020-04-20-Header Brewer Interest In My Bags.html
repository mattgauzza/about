<p>
The head brewer at the local brewery where I am getting the grain bags for this project has expressed interest in the bags. I gave him one of my bags for helping me out and he said the quality of the bags is very high. This is giving me the confidence to continue down the path of this project to see where it leads.

He also asked for me to make him a log carrier out of grain bags. I thought it would be an interesting and creative project. It's a pretty simple thing, just two grain bags sewn together almost like a pillow. I added some extra support to the handles and accross the carrier incase he is carrying some extremily heavy logs. It's pretty skookum, can even carry children haha.
