    Playing with my daughters mangetic tiles I've had an idea for a board game or at least hexagon tiles that can be used for a board game. 
    These hexagons will connect via magnets much like the magnetic tile toys

    I needed a 3-d modeling software to design the pieces. I attempted to use sketchup but found it extremily finicky. 
    Many of the legitimate modeling software has an extremily high learning curve. 
    This just being a low-fidelity prototype I am looking for a quick way to get into 3-d modeling with a low learning curve.
    After searching around I found this fantastic "kid friendly" online tool call Tinker Cad. It might not be the most high 
    brow of 3-d modeling software but it will allow me to get the prototype completed faster and won't bog me down in a bunch of glorp.
