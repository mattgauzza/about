    After many iterations I've found a hexagon design that meets all my criteria. It is stackable. 
    The pieces have distinctive features allowing them  to be versatile depending on game rules.
    The magnets are easy to install and do not come out after installed.
    The board very satisfyingly snaps together.

    After printing 15 of these hexagon tiles you can see how easy and satisfying to create a custom board.
    The terrain that can be established could also make for an interesting board. 
    The tiles are almost like a desktop fidget toy. 
    I have been thinking about the actual game to play on these now that I have the board more flushed out.
    Perhaps that is the wrong way to go about making a board game. 
    I am thinking that maybe the hexagons tiles would be interesting to use to help build board games.
    A toolkit for prototyping board games. It's certainly an interesting thought. 
    I will have to see where it leads.
