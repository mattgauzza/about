I’ve officially started working on Empirical, and things are shaping up! I'm building it with Ionic React and TypeScript, which gives me a nice balance of flexibility and maintainability. Right now, I'm focusing on getting the frontend together and using DaisyUI for the styling. It’s been smooth so far, and I love how quick I can whip up components with it.

The biggest challenge right now is figuring out the data structure for storing everything I want—research logs, mood tracking, and other entries. It’s a balancing act to make sure it’s easy to scale while keeping the app responsive.
