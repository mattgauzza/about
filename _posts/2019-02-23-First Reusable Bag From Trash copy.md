Made my first upcycled bag today out of grain bags from a local brewery. This pattern is based off of Adam Savages upcycled bag. I want to create a template in order to recreate it exactly.

The bag came out alright, appears to be pretty sturdy and they hold loads of groceries. I'm not sure about the decision to make the handles out of a grain bag. It might make more sense and be more skookum to just use traditional webbing for the handles.
