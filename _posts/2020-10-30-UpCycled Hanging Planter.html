    <h3>More Fun With Grain Bags</h3>
    <p>
      I have been thinking of other things that can be made from grain bags. I came up with this hanging garden bag.
      It works amazingly well (as long as you keep it watered). They can hold loads of weight
      due to the fact that the grain bags are made to hold 100 lbs of grain.

    <h3>About the Experimental Hanging Planters</h3>
    <p>
      Leafy plants appear to be working best.
      Plants that produce fruit don't seem to want to flourish. I will have to do some research into why that is.
      I made 2 hanging planters. One I planted with dirt the other I am attempting
      to do a hydroponics setup and so I used small clay balls that will trap the nutrients from the
      hydroponic juice.
    </p>
    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
    <p> I'm fortunate enough to have a nice greenhouse built on to the front of my house
      creating the perfect spot for this little project / experiment.
      If things go well I might run up an automated sprinkler system to the hanging planters.
      I already have a hose in the green house. We will see how this goes.
