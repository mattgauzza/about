    <h3>Large UpCycled Bag Order</h3>
    <p>
      I got an order for 30 upcycled bags from a company. There's no way that I can sew that many bags within
      and appropriate timeframe. 
      Looking around I found a few local seamstresses. One in particular really understood what I was 
      doing with upcycling. She also gave me some tips on how to produce them faster. She agreed to
      sew them for a price where we can both make money if I break down the grain bags, clean them and 
      cut them into the patterns. While I know how to sew most of what I know is self taught and probably 
      not the "right" way to do things. If I do partner with this seamstress I can learn a lot from 
      her as she has some fantastic experience. She has already taught me a few tricks that I did not know just 
      in our first meeting.

    <h3>Testing Out Micro Production</h3>
    <p>
      I'm not sure if "Micro Production" is a real word or I invented it. If you can have micro breweries
      why not anything else on a small local scale? Regardless, I am going to test this route out. If 
      I can find someone reliable and everyone is making some money and I am supporting more local 
      small businesses then everyone wins and I won't have to sew each bag individually.
