I was able to finish my "mass production" of upcycled reusable grocery bags. There are 20 bags in total. On average it took me about 1 1/2 hours per bag. The fact that the material is free is probalby the only way I could make profit with these if I were to sell them. The time spent per bag needs to be shorter.

I have put out some feelers to local sewers to see what it would cost for them to produce the bags if I clean them and cut them to the pattern first. I've gotten a wide range of responses to people that are not interested to people that really get the idea and want to see what I have in mind.
