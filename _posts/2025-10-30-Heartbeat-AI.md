> **Heartbeat AI** is always-on — an observer that listens to the rhythm of your digital world and takes context-driven action when it matters.

`AI` `event-driven` `context` `always-on`

Most AI tools today wait for you to ask a question.
**Heartbeat AI** doesn't.

It's not a chatbot. It's an _observer_. A _listener_. A _helper that thinks when you don't have time to_.

While traditional AI sits idle between prompts, Heartbeat AI quietly watches the rhythm of your digital world — your
calendar, notes, tasks, messages, and metrics — and takes action when it matters.

---

## Event-Driven, Not Timer-Driven

Heartbeat AI doesn't rely on fixed intervals or cron jobs.
It's **event-driven**, meaning it _wakes up_ when signals appear.

Those signals can come from anywhere:

- A new row added in Airtable
- A change in your GitHub repo
- An incoming message in Slack
- A new calendar event, email, or note
- A trigger from your **n8n** workflows

Once a signal hits, Heartbeat AI reads the context, updates its internal state, and decides what needs to happen next.

No wasted cycles. No “check every minute” logic. Just intelligent reactivity.

---

## Built to Connect

Heartbeat AI can ingest structured and unstructured data from multiple systems — think **Notion**, **Google Calendar**,
**Firebase**, **GitHub**, **Linear**, or **custom APIs**.

By connecting through **n8n**, it can subscribe to virtually any data source or event stream, turning your ecosystem
into one unified, living context map.

Your digital footprint becomes fuel for understanding patterns, priorities, and pain points.

## Integrated with Empirical

Where **Empirical** collects, organizes, and reflects on your personal data —
**Heartbeat AI** _acts on it_.

Empirical becomes the long-term memory;
Heartbeat is the _attention system_ — scanning for changes, surfacing insight, and prompting intelligent action.

Together they form an adaptive loop:

> Observe → Interpret → Act → Reflect

---

## What It Can Do

Heartbeat AI is more than automation — it's _autonomy guided by context_.

Imagine these scenarios:

- **Project awareness:**
  You merge a pull request; Heartbeat notices the connected issue isn't closed, summarizes the change, and posts an update
  to your team's channel.

- **Health and habit nudging:**
  You've logged low sleep and skipped workouts; Heartbeat suggests moving your morning meeting back 30 minutes.

- **Focus recovery:**
  After detecting task-switching and screen time spikes, it quietly sets your Slack status to “Heads Down” and mutes
  distractions.

- **Personal follow-up:**
  You mention “reach out to Alex” during a conversation — Heartbeat adds it to your tasks, sets a gentle reminder for next
  week, and logs the context.

It's not about replacing initiative — it's about _protecting your intent_.

---

## A Living AI, Not a Static Bot

This is where the paradigm shifts.

Heartbeat AI keeps thinking, even when you're not typing.
It maintains rolling context, builds semantic awareness of your behavior, and continues reasoning as new data arrives.

It doesn't wait to be asked.
It _notices_. It _responds_. It _remembers_.

---

## The Vision

In a world flooded with disconnected data, Heartbeat AI offers something rare:
**continuity** — a through-line between your actions, your information, and your goals.

It's the first step toward a true _digital companion_ — one that understands your world not because you told it
everything, but because it learned from the signals you already send every day.
