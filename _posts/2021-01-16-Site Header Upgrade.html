  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dated UI appearance</li>
      <li>Bloated CSS loading on every page</li>
      <li>Old Javascript relying on an out dated library of jQuery UI</li>
      <li>Navigation is hard to update for business</li>
      <li>Navigation UI is confusing to use for users</li>
      <li>Old HTML markup which does not use a grid system or flexbox</li>
      <li>Non responsive CSS / HTML requires developers to maintain 2 code bases</li>
    </ul> 
  </p>
  <h3>The Conversion</h3>
  <p>
    We were able to successfully upgrade the header and it is currently undergoing A/B split tested.
    Even if the split test doesn't result in a huge win I am going to 
    push to have it implemented as long as it is not a huge loss. The upgrade to 
    how the header is built allows for faster dev time, more custom navigation options, removes 
    several security vulnerabilities, removes loads of CSS / JS and lowers the dom size by using less HTML overall.
    All of these upgrades will result in a higher Google Core Web Vitals score which translates to faster page loads 
    and higher conversion rates.
  </p>
  <h3>What We Did:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Rebuilt the header from scratch using Bootstrap's grid system and flexbox</li>
    <li>Built the navigation as a new 'mega nav' to better align with current UI trends</li>
    <li>Created a json object of the nav instead of relying on database taxonomy</li>
    <li>Created a user friendly way to build json navigation that allows customization between sites</li>
    <li>Responsiveness - Entire header uses 1 HTML / CSS source which is responsive. Devs no longer have to manage 4 code spots when making small updates</li>
    <li>Replaced jQuery and jQuery UI plugins with new vanilla js custom built stream lined async web components</li>
  </ul>
