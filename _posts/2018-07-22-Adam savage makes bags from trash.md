[![Adam Savage makes a bag out of an old billboard](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AXzurpmc8SE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzurpmc8SE)

Adam Savage making a bag out of old Billboard material came across my feed today. I had the idea of using grain bags for some sort of cloth and thought this would be the best use. I'm going to give it a try.

I think my best course of action is to attempt to determine the pattern by watching the video and seeing if I can replicate it.
