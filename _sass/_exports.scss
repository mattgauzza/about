// Export (forward) the project's SCSS variables, mixins and small partials
// This file is the first safe step in migrating to the Sass module system.
// We will `@forward` local partials here and then `@use` this forwarder
// from the entrypoint `assets/main.scss`.

@forward "variables";
@forward "syntax-highlighting";
@forward "timeline";

// NOTE:
// - This forwarder exposes the project's variables/mixins/functions under
//   the current module namespace by default. In `assets/main.scss` we will
//   `@use "../_sass/exports" as *;` (relative resolution will be handled by
//   the Sass loader) so the exported symbols are available unprefixed.
// - This is intentionally conservative: we'll migrate partials one-at-a-time
//   after this is green to avoid breaking third-party vendor code.
